`KAIST-Radar (K-Radar)` (provided by ['AVELab'](http://ave.kaist.ac.kr/)) is a novel large-scale object detection dataset and benchmark that contains 35K frames of 4D Radar tensor (4DRT) data with power measurements along the Doppler, range, azimuth, and elevation dimensions, together with carefully annotated 3D bounding box labels of objects on the roads. K-Radar includes challenging driving conditions such as adverse weathers (fog, rain, and snow) on various road structures (urban, suburban roads, alleyways, and highways). In addition to the 4DRT, we provide auxiliary measurements from carefully calibrated high-resolution Lidars, surround stereo cameras, and RTK-GPS. This repository provides the `K-Radar` dataset, annotation tool for 3d bounding boxes, and the visualization tool for showing the inference results and calibrating the sensors.
